**MY GYM SITE**

This is a Duolingo inspired website meant to make your fitness goals fun and make you more proactive.

**How it's made**

Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS

The idea was to create a website/web app that combined fun with fitness. I also wanted a catchy name that would stick with the user so I opted to call it 'Fitnest'. Then I created different sections based on how long the user has been involved in fitness ranging from 'Novice' to 'Advanced'. I opted for a darker theme however it could always be changed through a light/dark mode toggle. I also included levels, reward based systems and hearts similar to Duolingo. I chose to use React JS because of its familarity and the access to its icon library which proved very beneficial to the development of this website.

**Lessons Learned**

Although, there were some aspects of the project that couldn't be completed, I gained valuable experience from this. I hindsight I could have used SCSS/SASS for this, but I still gained a lot from it.

Take a look at some of the screenshots of the project below..
